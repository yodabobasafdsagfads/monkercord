# Discord Clone using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Stream

This repository accompanies the series of blog posts published on the Stream Blog about creating a Discord clone using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and the Stream [Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/) and [Video](https://getstream.io/video/docs/) SDKs.

The series will have five posts at the end (we'll have the links updated once they are published):

- [Part 1: Setup Project](https://getstream.io/blog/discord-clone-project-setup/)
- [Part 2: General Layout and Server List](https://getstream.io/blog/discord-clone-server-list/)
- Part 3: Channel List UI (coming soon)
- Part 4: Message List UI
- Part 5: Adding video and audio calling

## Running the project

### Prerequisites

First, a machine running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the option to clone the repository. The rest of the setup is explained in [Part 1](https://getstream.io/blog/discord-clone-project-setup/).

Second, an account with Stream. We have a [free tier](https://getstream.io/pricing/#chat), and we can create an account for free using [this link](https://http://getstream.io/try-for-free/).

### Running locally

The first thing to do is install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then we can run the project on our machine in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
